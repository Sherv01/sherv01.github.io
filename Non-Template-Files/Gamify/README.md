# Gamify

This is a web game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Create the necessary files**:
    - Open the `gamify.html`, `gamify.css`, and `gamify.js` files in the `Gamify` directory in the GitHub repository.
    - For each file, copy the code, then open Notepad on your local machine.
    - Paste the copied code into Notepad.
    - Save the file with the same name as the original file (e.g., `gamify.html`), making sure to include the correct file extension (.html, .css, or .js). **You must ensure that the file names are exactly the same as how they appear in the `Gamify` directory.**
    - You may also use any other method you know of to download the files onto your own comnputer.

2. **Save the files in the same directory**: Ensure all created files are saved in the same directory on your local machine.

3. **Open the HTML file in a web browser**:
    - Open your file explorer and navigate to the directory where you saved the files.
    - Find the `gamify.html` file.
    - Right-click on the `gamify.html` file and select 'Open with'.
    - Choose a web browser from the list of programs.

The `gamify.html` file will then open in your chosen web browser, and you can interact with the web game.

Enjoy the game!
